#### **Design Rationale**
Gravity is by far one of the most important features to have inside of any video game. Most 3D platformers and exploration based games rely on predictable and logical gravity (9.8m/s²). By introducing a gravity switch mechanic, we want to test how changing the expectation of gravity can effect players navigation and problem solving puzzles. 

Games such as Mario Galaxy 1/2 experimented with gravity switching. For example in the first game inside of Good Egg Galaxy, where players must need to navigate twisting geometry by needing to understand how to go up and down using the mechanic, making them rethink their movements and orientation. Also inside of the second game there is a level called Upside Dizzy Galaxy with the same mechanic, but made into an entire level with more complex navigation, instead of just a little part of a certain level. In this stage, there are enemy's that can only be killed from one direction and every couple of seconds the gravity automatically switches with you having no control over it, forcing the players to adapt quickly.  Our prototype will be inspired by these moments but scaled down into a much smaller and simpler environment. 

The rationale is that gravity flipping could serve as a traversal method (similar to our first prototype) or as a puzzle solving challenge, making players think about orientation and how to approach certain obstacles. This mechanic could be a cool feature to have for puzzle solving, but it could also risk confusing players. We want to test and see if it improves puzzle solving and traversal, or disrupts it and causes more issues. 

#### **Objective**
Our main objective for this prototype is to try and test whether or not flipping gravity 180° can give fun and intuitive traversal (mostly from puzzles) while avoiding extreme player disorientation. We want to answer the question "**Can a gravity switch mechanic improve navigation and puzzle variety without being to overwhelming or annoying?**" 

To do this we will be making a small testing level (A very small obstacle course) where players are able to switch gravity 180° at will. This will allow them to walk on the ceilings and to reach inaccessible areas with regular gravity.

The prototype being simple makes sure we focus on the mechanic itself, not on a larger scale level creation. We will try to gather feedback on how some players think of our mechanic and whether or not it feels good or confusing. 

#### **Core Statement**
Is to create and develop a gravity switch mechanic where players can flip gravity 180° with a press of a button, allow to traverse on ceilings and floors. 

#### **Main Gameplay Overview**
The prototype is to allow the player to move freely inside of a small obstacle course, with walls and gaps that can only be navigated by flipping gravity. 

- Players will use WASD to move around
- Press the F key to flip gravity 180°
- When flipped the player and the camera will reorient so the ceiling becomes the floor
- Player camera and moving mechanics will be taken from last design prototype

#### **Team Roles** 
**Alice (Programmer):** Will be responsible for coding the gravity switch mechanic, including the player reorientation and making sure the player and camera transitions smoothly between the gravity states. 

**Ciaran (Designer/Documenter):** Will be responsible for fleshing out the design document, outlining the prototypes objectives, rationale, and core statements. Making sure that the projects vision is clearly communicated.

**Jasmine (Asset Finder/Supporter):** Will be responsible for finding free or open source assets to be used inside of the prototype, and will contribute to the design document and planning support.
